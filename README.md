Example Models for Interfacing between libretroshare and QML

This repository uses the retroshare-nogui code to launch Retroshare.
A QML Gui is then launched with example interfacing to Forum / Channel / Posted services.

To compile this code:
  1) Checkout Retroshare from sourceforge.net
  2) Clone this repository at the same level as libretroshare / retroshare-nogui.
  3) qmake; make - like the other repositories
